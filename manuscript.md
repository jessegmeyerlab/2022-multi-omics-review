## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Studies that integrate unbiased measurements across at least two omics layers are often referred to as "multiomics". Measurable "omes" include the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. Any combination of omic measures can be referred to as multiomics; for the scope of this review we focus on research combining proteomics and metabolomics. Mass spectrometry is the leading technique for analysis of the proteome and the metabolome. Due to improvements in sample preparation and data collection, more studies are incorporating both mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics. In this review, we discuss the perceived value of multiomics, advances in sample preparation and data collection, the current state of multiomic data integration, and clinical examples of multiomic analysis. Finally, we explore major barriers preventing democratization of mass spectrometry based multiomics to the same level as nucleic acid analysis, and we suggest solutions to break these barriers. 


## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Topics:


\[Importance of omic measurement\]: A major goal of biomedical research is understanding how changes in biomolecule compositions of cells and tissues lead to disease phenotypes. The genome serves as a library of possible transcripts, some of which are instructions for proteins, and proteins act on metabolites. The genome thus indirectly determines the set of possible cellular states, and the exact cellular state depends on the endogenous and exogenous environmental cues. To understand how the genome connects to phenotype, measurement of there genome must be accompanied by measurement of downstream layers of the central dogma of biochemistry. Measurement of multiple omic layers is know as multiomics.

## Sample Preparation for Multi-Omic Analysis

sample preparation for intergated multi-omics is a key factor for acquiring repeatable and robust results. 


Integrative multi-omics analysis is a powerful approach to study complex biological responses and has gained popularity in recent years.

3, Integrative sample prepatation for multi-omics 

In the context of multi-omics analyses, being able to perform multiple measurements on the same sample can also decrease experimental variation. In this section, 
we will review several integrative sample preparation technical advances that increased the capabilities of multiomic analysis. One important goal is to decrease the variation between different samples, ultimately to  .

## New developments of mass spectrometry-based methods for multi-omics 

4.1 proteomics 
 
4.1.1 Traditional standard methods for proteomics 

(Remember to mention here)



4.1.2 Direct infusion methods for proteome analysis (high-throughput methods)

For current proteomic analysis methods, time-consuming chromatographic separation (typically requiring 30–60 min per sample or even longer) is required to protect the coverage, 
repeatiability, robustness and quantification ability. However, with the rapid application of multiomics results in drug development, biomarker discovery studies and clinical 
diagnosis. High-throughput methods is highly desirable to boost these fields forward.[@url:https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-00999-z]

(as a high-throughput method, MALDI based proteome analysis should be mentioned here, for example,  the application of MALDI for identification of species of bacteria and fungas
through their specific peptides)


4.2 metabolomics 

To accurately and reliably interpret data derived from metabolomics and lipidomics studies, enormous mass spectrometry based methods were developed during the past decades.
(remember to mention the application of MALDI for metabolites analysis, although the drawback of MALDI-tof is obvious.(

Drawbacks: 1,the background of organic matrix in the low molecular weight region
           2,the obtained information of MALDI is still very limited, no more than 300 identified metabolites, and also quantification is difficult.   
           3,as a non-consistent ion source, currently TOF is the typical mass analyser for MALDI, which still suffers from relative low resolution. FTICR can connect MALDI )  


4.2.2 Direct infusion mass spectrometry methods for high-throughput analysis of metabolites.()

(direct infusion and so called flow injection MS. do not know the differences, seems saying the same thing.)

4.4 integrated methods

Mass spectrometry (MS) serves as the centerpiece technology for proteome and metabolome analysis. To gain a better understanding of the multifaceted
networks of myriad actions in complex organisms, integration of different multiomic layers is increasingly explored such as joint methods of different omics.
