Here, we demonstrate that gas-phase peptide separation instead of LC enables fast proteome analysis. Using direct infusion–shotgun proteome analysis (DI-SPA) by data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS), we demonstrate the targeted quantification of over 500 proteins within minutes of MS data collection (~3.5 proteins per second). We show the utility of this technology in performing a complex multifactorial proteomic study of interactions between nutrients, genotype and mitochondrial toxins in a collection of cultured human cells. More than 45,000 quantitative protein measurements from 132 samples were achieved in only ~4.4 h of MS data collection. Enabling fast, unbiased proteome quantification without LC, DI-SPA offers an approach to boost throughput, critical to drug and biomarker discovery studies that require analysis of thousands of proteomes.",

The advent of genotyping arrays enabled large-scale genome-wide association studies and methods for examining global transcript levels, which gave rise to the field of “integrative genetics”. Other omics technologies, such as proteomics and metabolomics, are now often incorporated into the everyday methodology of biological researchers. In this review, we provide an overview of such omics technologies and focus on methods for their integration across multiple omics layers. As compared to studies of a single omics type, multi-omics offers the opportunity to understand the flow of information that underlies disease.",

    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS) serves as the centerpiece technology for proteome, lipidome, and metabolome analysis. To gain a better understanding of the multifaceted networks of myriad regulatory layers in complex organisms, integration of different multiomic layers is increasingly performed, including joint extraction methods of diverse biomolecular classes and comprehensive data analyses of different omics. Despite the versatility of MS systems, fractured methodology drives nearly all MS laboratories to specialize in analysis of a single ome at the exclusion of the others. Although liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis is similar for different biomolecular classes, the integration on the instrument level is lagging behind. The recent advancements in high flow proteomics enable us to take a first step towards integration of protein and lipid analysis. Here, we describe a technology to achieve broad and deep coverage of multiple molecular classes simultaneously through multi-omic single-shot technology (MOST), requiring only one column, one LC-MS instrument, and a simplified workflow. MOST achieved great robustness and reproducibility. Its application to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae study consisting of 20 conditions revealed 2842 protein groups and 325 lipids and potential molecular relationships.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell-based genomics and transcriptomics analysis have revealed substantial cellular heterogeneity among seemingly identical cells. Knowledge of the cellular heterogeneity at multiomics levels is vital for a better understanding of tumor metastasis and drug resistance, stem cell differentiation, and embryonic development. However, unlike genomics and transcriptomics studies, single-cell characterization of metabolites, proteins, and post-translational modifications at the omics level remains challenging due to the lack of amplification methods and the wide diversity of these biomolecules. Therefore, new tools that are capable of investigating these unamplifiable “omes” from the same single cells are in high demand. In this work, a microwell chip was prepared and the internal surface was modified for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-based tandem extraction of metabolites and proteins and subsequent protein digestion. Next, direct electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was adopted for single-cell metabolome identification, and a data-independent acquisition-mass spectrometry approach was established for simultaneous proteome profiling and phosphoproteome analysis without phosphopeptide enrichment. This integrated strategy resulted in 132 putatively annotated compounds, more than 1200 proteins, and the first large-scale phosphorylation data set from single-cell analysis. Application of this strategy in chemical perturbation studies provides a multiomics view of cellular changes, demonstrating its capability for more comprehensive investigation of cellular heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Untargeted methods are typically used in the detection and discovery of small organic compounds in metabolomics research, and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) is one of the most commonly used platforms for untargeted metabolomics. Although they are non-biased and have high coverage, untargeted approaches suffer from unsatisfying repeatability and a requirement for complex data processing. Targeted metabolomics based on triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (TQMS) could be a complementary tool because of its high sensitivity, high specificity and excellent quantification ability. However, it is usually applicable to known compounds: compounds whose identities are known and/or are expected to be present in the analyzed samples. Pseudotargeted metabolomics merges the advantages of untargeted and targeted metabolomics and can act as an alternative to the untargeted method. Here, we describe a detailed protocol of pseudotargeted metabolomics using UHPLC-TQMS. An in-depth, untargeted metabolomics experiment involving multiple UHPLC-HRMS runs with MS at different collision energies (both positive and negative) is performed using a mixture obtained using small amounts of the analyzed samples. XCMS, CAMERA and Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM)-Ion Pair Finder are used to find and annotate peaks and choose transitions that will be used to analyze the real samples. A set of internal standards is used to correct for variations in retention time. High coverage and high-performance quantitative analysis can be realized. The entire protocol takes ~5 d to complete and enables the simultaneously semiquantitative analysis of 800–1,300 metabolites.",
