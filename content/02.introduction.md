## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Topics:


1. importance of omic measurement: Molecular profiles in biological systesms lead to macroscale phenotypes.
2. concept of multiomics
3. What is proteomics
4. what is metabolomics
     * polar metabolomics
     * lipidomics
5. what does multi-omic integration mean?
6. Other reviews
    
    Multiomic studies in mitochondria [@url:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165993619303668]
    * discussion of how to prepare samples, QC, and methods to analyze the samples by MS
    * includes mention of linking to functional (phenotype) readout

    Multi-omics approaches to disease [@url:https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1215-1]
    * overview of each omic technology
    * first section is discusses considerations for before multiomic studies: consider the exact disease, sample size, human samples versus model organisms, plan for analysis strategy before collecting data
    * second section is focus on methods for omic integration: 
    * third is future directions:
