\[Importance of omic measurement\]: A major goal of biomedical research is understanding how changes in biomolecule compositions of cells and tissues lead to disease phenotypes. The genome serves as a library of possible transcripts, some of which are instructions for proteins, and proteins act on metabolites. The genome thus indirectly determines the set of possible cellular states, and the exact cellular state depends on the endogenous and exogenous environmental cues. To understand how the genome connects to phenotype, measurement of there genome must be accompanied by measurement of downstream layers of the central dogma of biochemistry. Measurement of multiple omic layers is know as multiomics.

    Multiomic studies in mitochondria [@url:https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165993619303668]
    * discussion of how to prepare samples, QC, and methods to analyze the samples by MS
    * includes mention of linking to functional (phenotype) readout

    Multi-omics approaches to disease [@url:https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1215-1]
    * overview of each omic technology
    * first section is discusses considerations for before multiomic studies: consider the exact disease, sample size, human samples versus model organisms, plan for analysis strategy before collecting data
    * second section is focus on methods for omic integration: 
    * third is future directions:
