## Clinical applications of multi-omics (proteomics, metabolomics, and/or lipidomics)

Literature currently focused on proteogenomics (integration of genome, transcriptome, and proteome)"Clinical multi-omics strategies for the effective cancer management"[@URL:https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2018.00678]

Holistic approach has the ability to improve prognostics and predictive accuracy of disease phenotypes to aid in better treatment and prevention

Approaches in cancer research:
- "Integration of Proteomics and Metabolomics Revealed Metaboliteâ€“Protein Networks in ACTH-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma" [@URL:https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2018.00678]: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for metabolomics, plus nano liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry(nanoLC-MS/MS) proteomics. Using metabolomic and proteomic data to identify signaling pathways important in metabolic regulation of tumorigenesis. Reveal biomarkers for disease diagnosis, monitoring and therapeutic targets. Looking for changes in tumor on the pituitary gland (adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas (ACTH-PA)). Downregulated glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis. Myc signaling pathway significantly participated in the metabolic changes and tumorigenesis of ACTH-PA.
