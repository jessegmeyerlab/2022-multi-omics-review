## Sample Preparation for Multi-Omic Analysis


Integrative multi-omics analysis is a powerful approach to study complex biological responses and has gained popularity in recent years. To avoid the potential 
1, sample preparation for proteomics 



2, sample preparation for metabolomics

2.1 non-targeted metabolomics

3, Integrative sample prepatation for multi-omics 
In the context of multi-omics analyses, being able to perform multiple measurements on the same sample can also decrease experimental variation.
