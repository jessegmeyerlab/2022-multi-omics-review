## Sample Preparation for Multi-Omic Analysis

sample preparation for intergated multi-omics is a key factor for acquiring repeatable and robust results. 


Integrative multi-omics analysis is a powerful approach to study complex biological responses and has gained popularity in recent years.

3, Integrative sample prepatation for multi-omics 

In the context of multi-omics analyses, being able to perform multiple measurements on the same sample can also decrease experimental variation. In this section, 
we will review several integrative sample preparation technical advances that increased the capabilities of multiomic analysis. One important goal is to decrease the variation between different samples, ultimately to  .
