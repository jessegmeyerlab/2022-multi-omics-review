## Sample Preparation for Multi-Omic Analysis

sample preparation for intergated multi-omics is a key factor for acquiring repeatable and robust results. 


Integrative multi-omics analysis is a powerful approach to study complex biological responses and has gained popularity in recent years. 

1, Sample preparation for proteomics 
Protein preparation for MS analysis can be accomplished by many methods, so it is important to understand the steps leading to analysis. While intact proteins are typically studied by gel electrophoresis, the most common mass spectrometry workflows for complex protein samples analyze peptides, which are easier than proteins to fractionate by LC. Peptides also ionize and fragment more efficiently than whole proteins, resulting in spectra that are easier to interpret for protein identification. Peptide preparation involves reduction and alkylation of cysteines, digestion of the sample into peptides, desalting and concentration of the peptides and final analysis of these peptides by ionization (e.g., ESI) plus orbitrap-based MS.

3, Integrative sample prepatation for multi-omics 

In the context of multi-omics analyses, being able to perform multiple measurements on the same sample can also decrease experimental variation. In this section, 
we will review several integrative sample preparation technical advances that increased the capabilities of multiomic analysis. One important goal is to decrease the variation between different samples, ultimately to  .
