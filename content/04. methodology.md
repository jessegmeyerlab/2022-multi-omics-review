## New developments of mass spectrometry-based methods for multi-omics 

4.1 proteomics 
 
4.1.1 Traditional standard methods for proteomics 

(Remember to mention here)



4.1.2 Direct infusion methods for proteome analysis (high-throughput methods)

For current proteomic analysis methods, time-consuming chromatographic separation (typically requiring 30â€“60 min per sample or even longer) is required to protect the coverage, 
repeatiability, robustness and quantification ability. However, with the rapid application of multiomics results in drug development, biomarker discovery studies and clinical 
diagnosis. High-throughput methods is highly desirable to boost these fields forward.[@url:https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-020-00999-z]

(as a high-throughput method, MALDI based proteome analysis should be mentioned here, for example,  the application of MALDI for identification of species of bacteria and fungas
through their specific peptides)


4.2 metabolomics 

To accurately and reliably interpret data derived from metabolomics and lipidomics studies, enormous mass spectrometry based methods were developed during the past decades.
(remember to mention the application of MALDI for metabolites analysis, although the drawback of MALDI-tof is obvious.(

Drawbacks: 1,the background of organic matrix in the low molecular weight region
           2,the obtained information of MALDI is still very limited, no more than 300 identified metabolites, and also quantification is difficult.   
           3,as a non-consistent ion source, currently TOF is the typical mass analyser for MALDI, which still suffers from relative low resolution. FTICR can connect MALDI )  


4.2.2 Direct infusion mass spectrometry methods for high-throughput analysis of metabolites.()

(direct infusion and so called flow injection MS. do not know the differences, seems saying the same thing.)

4.4 integrated methods

Mass spectrometry (MS) serves as the centerpiece technology for proteome and metabolome analysis. To gain a better understanding of the multifaceted
networks of myriad actions in complex organisms, integration of different multiomic layers is increasingly explored such as joint methods of different omics.
