  "Integration strategies of multi-omics data for machine learning analysis" [@PMID:34285775]
  
  Split strategies into five categories
  
     Early integration: Place all omics datasets into single matrix
     
        tends to focus on largest dataset, missing data from other omic datasets [@PMID:18178960] 
        
        simple, easy implementation, allows ML models to learn interactions between layers
        
     Mixed integration: Map each dataset into new representation befrooe combining
     
     Intermediate integration: Transform datasets into common and omic-specific representations
     
     Late Integration: analyze each omic layer separately and combine final predictions
     
     hierachical integration: base integration of datasets on regulatory relationships between omic layers
